The Computer Configurator project aims to create a user-friendly website that allows users to easily select and assemble computer components. Users can check component compatibility, compare prices from various stores, and evaluate their custom builds against popular expert configurations. The web application will feature an overview of total assembly costs and detailed maintenance tips to ensure the longevity of each component.

Features:
1. User Profiles. Users can create profiles to save and name their custom builds for easy access and comparison.
2. Component Listings. Each component will be presented in a detailed list format, including specifications, accurate pricing from popular stores (such as Rozetka, Comfy, MOYO, Foxtrot), and direct links to those stores.
3. Search Functionality. Users can search components by name, release year, category, and specific characteristics.
4. Price Comparison. Compare prices from multiple retailers for optimal purchasing decisions.
5. Build Comparison. Users can compare their custom builds with effective pre-made configurations.
6. Maintenance Tips. Access helpful information on how to care for components to maintain functionality over time.
7. Compatibility Checker. Ensure that all selected components work well together before finalizing a build.
